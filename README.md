# This is my project 1 using ReactJS

This project was using components and css to style a 
wed UI, with flex and grid is core of the web. Also, 
web using hook useState to change state of a components.

Hopefully, this project can prove that I learn some basic 
html, css, javascript, a little bit ReactJS. Futhermore, 
some basic concept BEM (Block Element Modify).
