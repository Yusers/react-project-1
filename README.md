# This is my project 1 using ReactJS

This project used components and CSS to style a web UI, 
with flexbox and grid as the core layout techniques. 
Additionally, the web application utilizes the useState 
hook to manage component state.

I hope this project can demonstrate that I have learned 
the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of ReactJS. 
Furthermore, I have grasped some fundamental concepts of 
BEM (Block Element Modifier)."
